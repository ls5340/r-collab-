## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(readr)
Auto <- read.table("Auto.data",header=T,na.strings="?")
View(Auto)
Auto <- na.omit(Auto)
names(Auto)
quantitative <- c("mpg", "cylinders", "displacement", "horsepower", "weight", "acceleration", "year")
qualitative <- c("origin", "name")
quantitative
qualitative
quant = sapply(Auto,is.numeric)
quant
apply(quant_pred_range, 2, range,na.rm=TRUE)
apply(quant_pred_range, 2, mean,na.rm=TRUE)
apply(quant_pred_range, 2, sd,na.rm=TRUE)
quant_pred_range <- subset(Auto, select = colnames(Auto) %in% quantitative)
quant_data_updated <- quant_pred_range[-c(10:85),]
apply(quant_data_updated, 2, range,na.rm=TRUE)
apply(quant_data_updated, 2, mean,na.rm=TRUE)
apply(quant_data_updated, 2, sd,na.rm=TRUE)
